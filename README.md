# study_kconfig_sconscrip

#1 In first_demo folder,when we run "python kconfig_menu.py", it will generate a ".config" file, and then, run "python gen_config.py", it will generate 'config.h' base on '.config', finally, make the main.c to executable file, and run it, we will see some difference.

#2 Add the run scrip in top folder, edit the menu and build scrip in every son folder,so we can us "./run -name folder_name" to start the menuconfig and build the executable file
